.SH LOGGING
As it is mentioned in configuration, there are three options to handle logging of emptty. The logs contains not just logs from emptty, but also from Xorg (if used) and user's WM/DE.
Described log location could differ according configuration
.I LOGGING_FILE
, that is stored in
.I /etc/emptty/conf

.IP default
This option provides simple solution, when current instance of emptty logs into
.I /var/log/emptty/[TTY_NUMBER].log
and the previous version is stored as
.I /var/log/emptty/[TTY_NUMBER].log.old

.B NOTE:
Current instance always move previous log into old file, if emptty crashes and is started again, previous log is in
.I /var/log/emptty/[TTY_NUMBER].log.old

.IP appending
This option provides functionality that logs everything into
.I /var/log/emptty/[TTY_NUMBER].log
and does not handle log rotation by itself. It leaves the option for user to handle it themselves (e.g. with logrotate).

.B NOTE:
Appending without roration could cause large log file, be sure that log file is rotated.

.IP disabled
This option points all log into
.I /dev/null
, so no log is available.

.B NOTE:
If any issue starts to appear and you want to report it, ensure you do not use this option.
